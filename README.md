 Repository with Notebook that contains Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup. In this project I learned more about HTML, how I can get data from Web, store this data in a DataFrame and export to a .csv file.

Libs:
- bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
- urllib 
- pandas

Techniques:
- html language 
- automation in WebScraping
